  <h1>Queries</h1>
  <p>Queries allow you to search the KJV. Queries are performed on individual verses.</p>
  <p>Two query types are available: Word Query or Phrase Query.</p>
  <p>Word Queries are specified by a single word or a comma separated list of words. Query results will list all verses which contain all those words.</p>
  <p>For example, "forgive,sin" will find all verses that contain both "forgive" and "sin".</p>
  <p>Phrase Queries are specified by a word phrase. Query results will list all verses contain that phrase.</p>
  <p>For example, "son of man" will find all verses that contain the phrase "son of man".</p>
  <h2>Wildcards</h2>
  <p>Individual words in both Word and Phrase Queries may contain an optional wildcard character (*) to find variants of a word.</p>
  <p>For example, "lord*" will find all occurrences of "lord", "lords", "lord's", "lordly", or "lordship".</p>
  <h2>Case Sensitivity</h2>
  <p>To perform a case sensitive search, prepend an at sign (&#64;) to the Query.</p>
  <p>For example, "@LORD*" will find all occurrences of "LORD" and "LORD'S", but not "lord", "lords", "lord's", "lordly", "lordship", "Lord", or "Lord's".</p>
